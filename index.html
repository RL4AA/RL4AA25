After two very successful workshops in 2023 and 2024 in Karlsruhe and Salzburg, we are excited to announce the next workshop for 2025. RL4AA'25 will be hosted by DESY in the beautiful port city of Hamburg, Germany.</p><p>The workshop will bring together experts from the fields of machine learning, accelerator physics, and high-performance computing to discuss the latest developments in the field of reinforcement learning for autonomous accelerators. The workshop will feature invited talks, contributed talks, and poster sessions, as well as a panel discussion on the future of autonomous accelerators.</p><p>RL4AA welcomes seasoned RL practitioners as well as newcomers. We are doing our best to make sure there is something for everyone, from introductory tutorials to advanced research talks.</p><p>We are looking forward to welcoming you to Hamburg in 2025!</p><h2 id=keynote-speakers>Keynote Speakers</h2><p>We are the keynote speakers for this conference.</p><h2 id=impressions-from-rl4aa24>Impressions from RL4AA'24</h2><p>We are the impressions from the previous conference.</p><h2 id=organising-committee>Organising Committee</h2><p>We are the organisers of this conference.</p><h2 id=organising-institutions>Organising Institutions</h2><p>We are the institutions that are organising this conference.</p><h2 id=sponsors>Sponsors</h2><p>We are the sponsors of this conference.</p><footer>&copy; RL4AA Collaboration &nbsp;|&nbsp; Design by
