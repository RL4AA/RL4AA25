## What is RL4AA'25?

RL4AA'25 is the third instalment of the workshop series organised by the [Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Accelerators (RL4AA) Collaboration](https://rl4aa.github.io/). After two very successful workshops in 2023 and 2024 in Karlsruhe and Salzburg, we are excited to announce the next workshop for 2025. RL4AA'25 will be hosted by DESY in the beautiful port city of Hamburg, Germany.

The workshop will bring together experts from the fields of machine learning, accelerator physics, and high-performance computing to discuss the latest developments in the field of reinforcement learning for autonomous accelerators. The workshop will feature invited talks, contributed talks, and poster sessions, as well as a panel discussion on the future of autonomous accelerators.

RL4AA welcomes seasoned RL practitioners as well as newcomers. We are doing our best to make sure there is something for everyone, from introductory tutorials to advanced research talks.

We are looking forward to welcoming you to Hamburg in 2025!

## Keynote Speakers

We have a very exciting line-up of keynote speakers, and are very much looking forward to their talks!

Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He is best known to the general public for his massâ€“energy equivalence formula E = mc^2, which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.
